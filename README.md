## Installation
1. conda create -n nlp python=3.8
2. conda activate nlp
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. <em>(pip install allennlp==2.9.3 allennlp-models==2.9.3 cached-path==1.1.2) &#8594; OPCIJSKO: glede na to, da allennlp itak ne dela</em>
5. python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

## CoreNLP Server
To get family relations triplets using CoreNLP you need first to download CoreNLP from [Download page]{https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html}.
Then open the `cmd` in the directory where you downloaded the CoreNLP and run `java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -port 9000 -timeout 15000`.
After that you need to modify the `server_url` in `core_nlp.py` file to the IP value of the host where the server runs.

## Usage
To reproduce the results we obtained in this repository you should run `pipeline.py`. This will generate the family relation triplets and save it in a file.
To evaluate the results you should run `eval.py` where you should change the path to file with the triplet results.
To visualize the graph of family relations you should run `visualization.py`.
